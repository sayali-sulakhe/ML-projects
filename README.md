# ML-projects
Basic ML projects


This repository contains basic projects that i made while learning the machine learning and practicing the ml codes/algorithms.

Given below is description to each project:

1.**`HEART-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION-ü´Ä:`**
Heart-disease-classification project is supervised machine learning(classification) project that uses libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib,scikit-learn,seaborn,xgboost,catboost.This project predicts whether the person has a heart disease or not using various features like gender,age,chest pain type etc...all other features are explained in detailed in the jupyter notebook.

2.**`End-to-End-Bulldozer-Price-Predictionüöú:`**
Bulldozer-Price-Prediction is supervised regression problem which uses libraries  numpy,pandas,scikit-learn,matplotlib.This project predicts the price of bulldozer using the various features given and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for.

3.**`Dog-visionüê∂:`**
Dog-vision is end-to-end on a multi-class image classification problem which uses libraries like tensorflow 2.0,tensorflow hub,deep learning neural networks,numpy,pandas,scikit-learn,matplotlib.This project predicts the breed of dog , provided the photo of dog.
